# Weedeeoart

Video\audio randomization generative art tool, vfx and other experimental stuff. Based on moviepy. YTP (You Tube Poops) inspired.
At this moment it takes all video formats that can find in specified folders, breakes it onto random fragments and add various filters based on pipeline that specified in preset.py

# Using

* python Gui-tk.py
* python preset.py 'F:\path\to\folder'

# TODO
* Serialized pipeline configs instead of presed.py (JSON or YAML)
* Full description based on docstrings
* Console interface (click, argparse or so)
* Further GUI developing
* Dockerify app
* Web based interface and image gallery (Django?)
* Image mixing
* Titles
* Filters from Wand, OpenCV
* Face recognition and video masking
* Video search
* Deforms
* Machine learning on videos
* Bells and whistles
